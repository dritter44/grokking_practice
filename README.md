# Welcome to the Grokking Read Me file

## Before you start a leetcode, follow these steps
### 
1. Generate a test file in vscode
2. Generate a function file in vscaode
_In test File_
3. import the function from the function file (format for py is "from <filename> import <function>")
4. def main function
5. invoke main function. invoked after the print statements
6. Decide on the tests for your function (there should generally be given to you in a leetcode problem). pseudo code those test into rows on comments in the test file
7. Determine what the outputs from the test file should look like
8. write your print statements out, with the comments, then call the function that converts the answer to a string.
